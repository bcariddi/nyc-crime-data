# nyc-crime-data
Our data visualization Project for Computing Service -- a map of NYC Crime data. We used NYPD Complaint data from 2015-2020. We parsed the data from the file found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i). We used a tutorial found at [this link](https://towardsdatascience.com/new-to-data-visualization-start-with-new-york-city-107785f836ab) to guide our process.
