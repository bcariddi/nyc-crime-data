# nyc-crime-data
Our data visualization Project for Computing Service -- a map of NYC Crime data. We used NYPD Complaint data from 2015-2020. We parsed the data from the file found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i). We used a tutorial found at [this link](https://towardsdatascience.com/new-to-data-visualization-start-with-new-york-city-107785f836ab) to guide our process.

## Disclaimer
The data we used came from the governement of New York and New York City. Our complaint data by precinct was labeled as "valid" data. No explanation was given about what makes the complaint valid or not, so please use caution when examining our visualizations.
